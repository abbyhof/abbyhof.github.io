Let's analyze the `beer_data` data:

```{r}
beer_data <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv")
```


```{r}
#| results: asis
rmarkdown::paged_table(beer_data) 
```

## Purchase Patterns

We'll explore the purchase patterns in the dataset. This includes understanding the most popular brands, the average quantity purchased, and spending habits across different markets. Here are some specific analyses we can perform:

- Calculate the total quantity and spending for each brand.

- Find the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase.

- Compare the total spending across different markets.

I'll begin with these analyses and create visualizations to help us understand the data better. Let's start by calculating the total quantity and spending for each brand.
